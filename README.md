Text-based adventure game (sem 1)

Few pointers:
1. Do change the path of the images in the code accordingly after downloading them to your local system.
2. The image paths have been put up in lines 14, 278, 470, 595, 609, 629, 789, 807, 1014, 1095, and 1162.
3. Read the rules at the beginning of the game carefully.(lol)
